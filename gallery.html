      <p class="tab-text">
        Happy Birthday again, sayang 🌸  
        Even though you already read it, I still want this letter to stay here —  
        because every word came straight from my heart.  
        <br><br>
        To my sunshine, my sugar, my love ☀️🍯❤️ hola, amor 💋<br><br>

Happy Birthday, 21st yeah? 🎂🎉 You’re officially an adult now 🥂 It’s legal for you to have drinks and enter the club now xixixi 😆💃<br><br>

I’ll copy your message opening for me, which I also wanna thank God 🙏, because today, 21 years ago, you were born 🌷 God deserves the credit on my bright days and smiles these past days, weeks, months ☀️💫<br><br>

Hai sayang 🥰, It’s finally your day once again 🎈 And a birthday is worth celebrating for 🎊 So celebrate it well, create some beautiful moments, smiles, and laughter for yourself today, because it’s your day 💖<br><br>

I hope that in this age, you will be granted more power 💪 to face the challenges you face in your life, because I know you have the ability and potential to reach any goal that you want 🌟 That’s how great you are in my eyes, darling 💞<br><br>

Some basic wishes, but I really hope that smile always rises on your face 😊 Always be healthy all the time 💪🍀, love your family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, always be blessed ✨, have all the positive energy in the world for you 🌸, grow every day 🌱, because you wanna see me on the top right? 😏 I hope that you will be standing beside me on the top too 🏔️🤝<br><br>

Thank you for giving me all the love you have 💗 even though there are so many things that I lack 😔 I still can’t believe that you are mine 🥹 someone willing to love me when I’m not yet at my best version 💞 You are always there for me, and think about me, even when you don’t have to 🥺 I can't even measure how grateful I feel that you are here sayang 💖<br><br>

Writing these while reading your message you gave to me 💌, ofc I have to make the wish stronger by saying that I hope that we can be together as long as heaven permits 🌈 I still need more time to make you proud 💫, to be your happiness 🥰, to be the best version of myself for you 💪 You deserve all the love in the world 🌍 sayang 💕 And I want to give all the love you deserve 💐<br><br>

Thank you so much for being here sayang 💗<br><br>

Love you, honey 😘<br>  
Aldo 💖
